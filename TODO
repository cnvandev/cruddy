TODO
==============================================================================

- Stop importing everything, clean this all up.
- Verify the schema is valid for our objects, not that the database exists.
- Verify the entire folder/file structure of twitter bootstrap, not that the folder is there.
- "Static generator" module to create some static content templates (homepage, about, etc.)
- Get a better way to generate the HTML. Maybe develop your own HTML-generation library.
- On top of whatever HTML-generation solution you use, make a Twitter Bootstrap library to make generating the Bootstrap elements easier.
- Make a more flexible housekeeping module, maybe with a specific form for objects to ensure (like "ensure we have this file, if not download it from here. If it's a zip file, extract it" etc.)
- Support JSON objects!
- Now that it's working, style it a little bit.
- Support elements that come up a lot, emails and pictures and links.
- Support links between other elements.
- Create a formal API for it.
- Generate Android and iOS apps to access the data!
