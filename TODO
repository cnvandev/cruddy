TODO
==============================================================================

- Verify the schema is valid for our objects, not that the database exists.
- "Static generator" module to create some static content templates (homepage, about, etc.)

- Verify the entire folder/file structure of twitter bootstrap, not that the folder is there.
- Make a more flexible housekeeping module, maybe with a specific form for objects to ensure (like "ensure we have this file, if not download it from here. If it's a zip file, extract it" etc.)

- Write Twitter Bootstrap library to make generating the Bootstrap elements easier.

- Support links between other elements.

- Support JSON objects!
- Now that it's working, style it a little bit.
- Support elements that come up a lot, emails and pictures and links.
- Create a formal API for it.
- Generate Android and iOS apps to access the data!
