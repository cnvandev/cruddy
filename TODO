TODO
==============================================================================

- Oh god, motherfucking *everything*. Moved stuff into HTMLGenerator.py,
  DBStorage.py and a simple everything-class called utilities.py. Will
  probably want to move everything out of utilities.py and into some kind of
  self-contained object-parsing function to allow for easier retrieval.
- Similarly, I want to abstract the objects behind this meta-object wall so
  that I don't have to deal with this type hash bullshit and keep everything
  nice and clean. Meta-objects.
- Fix the add and double-check view and list...get it to work -_-""
